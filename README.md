# DELL-DW1820A-Drivers
This repo will contain drivers for DW1820A m.2 2230 Wifi card for Mac/Windows/Linux.



I was asked about the card i chose for my Lenovo Thinkpad T440P Hackintosh Project.

git@github.com:ameeno/Lenovo-Thinkpad-T440P-Hackintosh.git




Most of the wifi cards for this laptop are $50+ USD.

but i decided as it was just a project, i would take a punt at a low cost card that is only around $10USD on aliexpress.

I purchased it from here:
https://m.aliexpress.com/item/32895346062.html


As you can see, at the time of writing this card is $10.51 usd shipped globally.

The card also supports 5ghz Wifi (867mbps) + Bluetooth 4.1

Personally i think the card is fantastic.

*HOWEVER*
It does not work out of the box on MacOS Mojave or Win10 Or Even Linux.

It requires patches and modifications/drivers.


Fortunately for you guy's friends, I have done the hard work already in getting the card fully working, so you don't have to.

Please enjoy my repository, and look in the respective folders for each flavor of OS you prefer.
