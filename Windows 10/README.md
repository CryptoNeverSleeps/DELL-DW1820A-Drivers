### Instructions



This Repository contains Drivers (Install able EXE) i have found successfully work on Windows 10.


Note, The drivers need to be forcefully installed via device manager -> I have a disk option, and untick the "Show compatible devices only" option in windows.

Windows will warn you that the drivers may not be compatible with your hardware,

Just ignore the warning and continue, they work Great.


***NOTE**
Windows WILL try to default to MS bluetooth drivers and its own drivers for the hardware.

In my experience these do not work too well, and the drivers i have posted work much better.

But YMMV,

Good luck & Enjoy.
